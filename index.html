                    <h1>Mechanics and Features</h1>
                    <p>The features are fairly basic, Using a google maps plugin, the user can see where current protests are taking place. By clicking on the map pin, the user will be able to access more information on the protest. I.e. information on the cause, date, time, police risk, and the amount of people. There is also a social media aspect, as social media is an important tool in modern day protests, from photos to status and tweets, it has it all. The app is also equipped with safety features, such as a report button. If a user feels the protest is becoming violent, the report button will notify the proper authorities to maintain safety in the area. There is also a risk button, which will let the user know based on the size, and the intentions of the protest, the level of predicted safety. The higher the risk is, the more likely police will have to be involved. The RSPV section, is where users can show their interest in being involved. This gives an estimated outcome to the app, which will be used in the algorithm to calculate the risk and numbers of the protest. The RSPV section also gives the user a list of protests which the user may be interested in. Along with information, such as dates and times. The crew feature is more of a social aspect. The algorithm sees people in the network, and is able to pinpoint where the users in the same social network are located in the crowd. If a user wishes to find their friends, the app will help with the visualisation tool to do so.
